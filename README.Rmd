# Overview

For this problem set you will need to analyze some ChIP-seq data to
identify a mystery factor X.

## Goals

1. Learn to align FASTQ reads to a genome (create a BAM file)

1. Convert BAM alignments into bedGraph format

1. Convert bedGraph to bigWig (for UCSC track display)

## Installation

Need to install some pacakges:

### On a mac

```bash
$ brew install bowtie2 samtools kent-tools meme bedtools
$ pip install macs2
```

### On tesla

```bash
$ module load bowtie2 samtools ucsc meme bedtools
```

## Workflow

1. Align FASTQ data to the human genome with bowtie2

1. Create a bedGraph file of signal.

1. Call peaks from the bedGraph data using MACS2

1. Generate FASTA format from the peaks and identify motifs

1. Compare peaks to ENCODE peak calls using `bedtools jaccard`

1. Create a track in the UCSC Browser containing your peak data
